After further observation, you also find two more doors in the room. The one to your west is pearly white with jewel encrusted, round gold handles. Two sea shell knockers sit far above them at almost the top of the doors. Through the cracks at the door hinges, you can just barely see something bright orange flickering inside. You can feel an unbearable heat emanating from the room just standing outside. You quickly move onto the next door to escape it. The second door to your east is fully glass, handle and hinges aside. The room inside is mostly darkened, but you can see something shining just inside the door, illuminating a lengthy hallway. You can either head back into the endless darkness of the cavern you woke up in, or pick a door to enter. What will you do?")

Your hands continue to sting. Perhaps there is a way to help soothe them around?
